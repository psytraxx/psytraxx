# Hi there, I'm Eric Funk 👋

> **Code Monkey, Father, Traveller.**

I am a developer with a diverse set of interests ranging from high-level web applications to low-level embedded systems. My passion lies in building scalable backends, tinkering with IoT devices, and exploring the safety and performance of Rust.

### 🚀 About Me

- 🔭 I’m currently working on **Embedded Rust** projects and **IoT** home automation.
- 🌱 I’m deeply interested in **Rust** (especially `no_std` for ESP32)
- ⚡ **Fun fact:** I can build a full-stack reactive chat app, but I also enjoy flashing custom firmware onto cheap Tuya LED controllers to make them do my bidding.
- 🌍 When I'm not coding, I'm likely traveling or fulfilling my duties as a dad.
